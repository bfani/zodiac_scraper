# zodiac_scraper

A Wikipedia-scraper that aims to extract as many people, their occupations and birthdates from Wikipedia as possible, to empirically debunk
the myth of zodiac signs beeing an important influence for your personality. The assumption that is made here is that your personality
has an influence to the occupation you are choosing in your life. Of course only people who are "famous" enough to get a Wikipedia-page
can be included in this dataset, but assuming that you need a certain personality to reach or even strive for that kind of fame,
it should show a distortion of the collected data - IF zodiacs have an influence.
